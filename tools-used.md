### Ethereum Blockchain Network

#### Why are we building our app on Ethereum Newtwork?
- Financial services running on Ethereum have no sign up requirements. If you have funds and an internet connection, you’re good to go.
- There’s a whole world of tokens that you can interact with across these financial products. People are building new tokens on top of Ethereum all the time.
- Teams have built stablecoins – a less volatile cryptocurrency. These allow you to experiment and use crypto without the risk and uncertainty.

Developers can build dApps, or decentralized applications, which can be executed on the Ethereum network on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The global state of Ethereum therefore consists of more than just the balance of every account, but also the state of each dApp.

#### Where on Ethereum Blockchain Network are we building our app?
In order for developers to test their applications, Ethereum offers public testnets. You should test any contract code you write on a testnet before deploying to Mainnet.

We are using a public testnet called Goerli. Goerli is a proof-of-stake testnet. It is expected to be maintained long-term as a stable testnet for application developers.

#### Purpose of Building apps on Ethereum Network
The general-purpose nature of Ethereum allows for any number of possible applications to be built on top of it, which all inherit the security and decentralization benefits that come from running on the Ethereum blockchain.

### CRANQ
Graphical and intutive IDE that allows us to compile and deploy smart contracts. It has a GUI where you can visually track how the code is being executed by looking at its flow.
This way you can understand how smart contracts truly work BTS. It makes it easier for you to build on other people's code. We used CRANQ and built our application on the top of Uniswap's code base. Cranq helps us abstract the most critical functionality from these smart contracts and allow us to build on the top of them.
CRANQ has drag and drop features, which allows us compile and deploy smart contracts from the uniswap's code base easily.

### Crypto Wallet
Crypto wallets are a manager for your accounts, and mainly their private keys. They also allow you to interact with decentralized applications, and allow connecting to a dApp through the wallet, acting as a single sign-on for all applications built on the blockchain.

### Metamask
MetaMask is the trailblazing tool enabling user interactions and experience on Web3. It is currently available as a browser extension and as a mobile app on both Android and iOS devices. 
MetaMask was created to meet the needs of secure and usable Ethereum-based web sites. In particular, it handles account management and connecting the user to the blockchain.

What advantages does MetaMask have?
- Popular - It is commonly used, so users only need one plugin to access a wide range of dapps.
- Simple - Instead of managing private keys, users just need to remember a list of words, and transactions are signed on their behalf.
- Saves space - Users don’t have to download the Ethereum blockchain, as MetaMask sends requests to nodes outside of the user’s computer.
- Integrated - Dapps are designed to work with MetaMask, so it becomes much easier to send Ether in and out.

### ERC20 Tokens

- Just write about what ERC20 tokens are. 
- I cannot really explain say why we are using 
- You think of it as just another feature of the app where user can exchange self created tokens.

### useDApp
What is useDApp?
- useDApp is a framework to make DApp UX & DX better, built on top of modern DApp stack: React, ethers.js, TypeScript, TypeChain, and Multicall.

Why useDApp matters for Ethereum?
- Lowering the entry barrier to start building DApps means more developers in the blockchain industry and higher quality apps in the ecosystem.

useDApp makes existing blockchain developers’ work easier & faster, and helps to bridge the gap between web2 and web3, abstracting away basic blockchain operations for new developers.

- we are using this tool because it gives a pre built file and folder structure
- This gives is a comfortable environment for learning how to build decentralized applications using React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application using React.

### Netlify
- write what netlify is
- We are using this to deploy our application on the internet
