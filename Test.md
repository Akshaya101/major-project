### Purpose of the Project (May be 3/4 page)
- What is DeFi, what are DeFi apps
- Importance of DeFi Applications in current scenarios
- What is our application about

```
A decentralized finance application is a .... (2-4) lines.
How using blockchain helps in DeFi Apps (Another 4-5)
```

### Problems with existing 
- We can talk about how centralized exchange are not useful (Eg of the bank taking fee)
- What are the problems that arise in CE that we are solving here

### Proposed Systems
- What are DEX? 
- So how we developed this application (Application goal)
- Use of apps that involve the AMM protocol, especially when it comes to finance

### Scope of the Project
- We have to stretch the goal, mix up problem + proposed and write something in a paragraph where we say 
> since we have this problem, we are going to this to solve the problem, so by doing this we are reducing or saving this much amount of work

### Architecture design 
I have no idea about this

### Technologies used
- We will be building this application on the Ethereum network
    - so we can talk a lil bit about that
- We will be using crypto wallet here 
    - What is a crypto wallet
    - You can write about different types of crypto wallets
- We are using Cranq to develop smart contracts
    - you can read about cranq, if you can find good stuff on google ante inka better
    - [Here](./DetailedExplanationOfApp.md)
    - [Here](./SH.md)
- We are going to create our own crypto currency replicates also called as ERC 20 Tokens
    - [We'll create the token here](https://www.smartcontracts.tools/token-generator/create/ethereum/)
- We will be using React for front end
    - This is like create-react-app for DApps
    - [We will be using this tool to get the file folder structure](https://usedapp.io/)
    - 2/3 lines about this
- We will deploy this app on netlify
