Usually for exchnaging currency in real time we go to prime sources which are banks, for converting from rupees to dollars they take a fee for providing you with the exchange service. In order for you to use their service, you are supposed to provide your personal information to the banks, they have access to your sensitive bank information, plus they are getting other form of currency for less than what they are asking you to pay for. For example they get a currency for much less amount than they sell it you. 
Bank is a centralized authority. They are the ones who decide what currency should be sold on what rate. This gives them the power to be reckless too since they are the only providers.

When it comes to cryptocurrency exchanges, there are mainly two types of exchanges, centralized exchange and decentralized exchange.

**Centralized crypto exchanges** that act as a middleman between the buyer and the seller and make money through commissions and transaction fees.
Popular CE service providers are Binance, Coinbase etc.
These centralized exchanges take your personal information inorder to carry out a simple exchange trasaction. Plus they often charge a very high transaction fee for carrying out the exchange.

**Decentralized crypto exchanges** allows peer-to-peer transactions directly from your digital wallet without going through an intermediary. These decentralized exchanges rely on smart contracts, self-executing pieces of code on a blockchain. These smart contracts allow for more privacy and less slippage (another term for transaction costs) than a centralized cryptocurrency exchange.
For you to use a DEX all you need is your digital wallet, they don't take your personal information and they offer anonimity to their users.

The main problem with CE is that most CEs will hold your private keys and will only allow you to buy or sell assets instead of you having control over your funds. Users of decentralized exchanges do not need to transfer their assets to a third party. Therefore, there is no risk of a company or organization being hacked, and users are assured of greater safety from hacking, failure, fraud, or theft.

We are here trying to build an application which is decentralized and allows users to exchange one form of crypto into another. For carrying out the trasactions, the applications does not charge any fee.

We are not asking for your personal information to carry out the trasactions, all we need is your digital wallet address to allow transactions.

This is application is being built on the ethereum network, and it allows you to carry out exchanges amongst the combinations of native cryptocurrencies, ERC20 and stable coins.

It has a simple and easy to use user interface. 

This application takes crypto funds from its users. These funds are stored in liquidity pools with each pool containing different pairs of cryptocurrencies. This platform uses blockchain-based smart contracts to facilitate the decentralized trading of many different digital assets. Pairs of digital assets are swapped via liquidity pools, which use smart contracts to automatically rebalance after every trade.

We use smart contracts in order to carry out exchnages this application. Smart contracts enable asset trading that may be cheaper and more efficient.

Building and using this applications 
- solves the problem of trusting a platform with sensitive information
- maintain anonimity and carry out the action of exchange of currency
- the exchange rate is decided by the smart contract (which cannot be altered) thus making it authority free.
- easier user interface

How it works in simple terms 
a user picks an input token and an output token. They specify an input amount, and the protocol calculates how much of the output token theyâ€™ll receive. They then execute the swap with one click, receiving the output token in their wallet immediately.
