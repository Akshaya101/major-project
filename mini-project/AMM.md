## Brief
#### What is AMM?
AMM (Automated Market Maker) protocol is an underlying protocol used by decentralised exhanges with autonomous trading mechanisms. These DEX allows users to transact their assets without any intermediary facilitating the exchange.

#### What is a Market Maker?
- Market Makers are liquidity(how quickly an asset can be bought or sold) providers. 
- A wants Bitcoin, centralised exchange(CE) looks for someone who is selling bitcoin, say B
- The CE is acting as a middleman, they are gonna take a cut for doing this job for A.
- What id there is no one selling or bying those tokens/type of cryptocurrency?
    - This is where market makers are needed, people who provide tokens to the network for carrying out transactions.
    - This is where market makers are needed. Certain financial Institutions provide liquidity by creating buy/sell orders to match order of investors
    (Instruction to a broker to buy or sell something at best available price)
    - The entity who provides the liquity becomes the market maker
- This is a disadvantage because one single entity is being given the power to decide the price of a certain good. If they are the only people that are selling it, then they are the deciders of the price. 

#### How are AMM different from MM?
AMM are DEX. They remove intermediaries for exchanging crypto assets. AMM's can be considered as computer programme that automates the process of providing liquidity. These protocols (back to AMM definition, underlying protocol used by decentralised exhanges with autonomous trading mechanisms) are built using smart contracts -- a computer code that executes itself -- to mathematically define the price of the crypto tokens and provide liquidity.

In the AMM protocol, you do not need another trader to make a trade. Instead, you can trade with a smart contract. So trades are peer-to-contract and not peer-to-peer. If you want to trade a particular crypto asset with another, like Ether (ethereum's native currency) for Tether (ethereum token pegged to the US dollar), you need to find an individual ETH/USDT liquidity pool. As mentioned above, what price you get for an asset you want to buy or sell is determined by a mathematical formula.

In AMM, anyone can be a liquidity provider if they meet the requirements stipulated in the smart contract. So, in this example, the liquidity provider will need to deposit a pre-determined amount of Ether and Tether tokens to the ETH/USDT liquidity pool. In return for providing liquidity to the protocol, the liquidity providers can earn fees from trades in their pool.

#### Advantages of AMM
- sets up a system of liquidity where anyone can contribute to it
- removes any intermediary transaction fee for investors
- since it is a liquidity pool from which exchange is carried out, it is healthy for trading activity.
- as a liquidity provider you can get a fraction of the fees paid on transactions executed on pool.
